# district-pipelines

This project contains docker and docker compose files for deploying qa and production environments of different districts.

## Installation

You need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
  sudo apt-key add -

export LSB_ETC_LSB_RELEASE=/etc/upstream-release/lsb-release
